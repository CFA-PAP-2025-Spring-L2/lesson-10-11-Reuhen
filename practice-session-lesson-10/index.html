            <h3>My mom</h3>
            <p>While my dad introduced me to the world of tech, my mom has been the constant source of resilience and compassion in my life. Her dedication to our family and unwavering belief in my potential have grounded me through every challenge and helped shape the values I carry into my academic and career goals.</p>

     <h3>My dad</h3>
     <p>My interest in Computer Science was inspired in part by my dad, who works in tech and has always encouraged me to explore how things work beneath the surface. Growing up, Iâ€™d watch him solve problems and build systems, and over time, his passion for technology became my own.</p>
